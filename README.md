# Unicorn Identification and Analysis for Investment Opportunities
Driven by my interest in financial data analysis, I undertook a project to identify companies valued at over $1 billion, known as "unicorns." The goal was to provide insights into profitable businesses by analyzing financial datasets, addressing the common issue of missing values. I applied data-cleaning techniques such as removing or imputing missing data, ensuring accurate exploratory data analysis (EDA) without introducing bias. This analysis could help investors make more informed and strategic decisions about future investment opportunities in high-growth companies.
